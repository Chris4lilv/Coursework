## Map with Hashing
<p>Design and develop the data structure representing a Map object by layering it on top of <em>Array</em> and <em>Map</em> itself. The algorithmic approach is to use hashing to immediately narrow every search to a much smaller <em>Map</em>. A JUnit test is performed on implementations of all the constructors and kernel methods defined in interface <em>MapKernel</em>.<p>

## Set On Binary Search Trees
<p>Design and develop the data structrue representing a <em>Set</em> object based on top of binary tree. The purpose of using binary search tree is to produce a reduction in search time. A JUnit test is performed on implementations of constructor and all kernel methods.<p>

## Sorting Machine with Heapsort
<p>Design and develop the data structure representing a <em>SortingMachine</em> object based on top of Queue and Array. Sorting algorithm <em>Heapsort</em> is applied here. A JUnit test is performed on implementations of constructor and all kernel methods.</p>

## List with Retreat
<p>Design and develop a representation that involves a doubly-linked list of nodes using Java reference. A JUnit test is performed on implementations of constructor and all kernel methods.</p>

## Implementation of Program and Statement kernels
<p>Implement and test the constructor and all kernel methods defined in interfaces ProgramKernel and StatementKernel.</p>

## BL Parser
<p>Implement a recursive-descent parser for the BL language.</p>

## Tag Cloud Generator
<p>This is a Java program that generates a tag cloud from a given text.</p>

## WaitingLine Family Design
<p> Design the interfaces for a new component family called <em>WaitingLine</em>. <em>WaitingLine</em>component family is trying to capture the idea of a waiting line like you might encounter at a restaurant. </p>

## Hashing Experiments
<p>The program takes various hash table sizes and files as input, then do hashing on the hundred lines of text in the file. The purpose of this project is to get familiar with hashing, including hashcode, hash function and mod.</p>

## Java Collections Framework(JCF) Exploration
<p>The purpose of this lab is to get familiar with JCF components by implementing two methods using both JCF components and OSU components.</p>

## Java IO Exploration
<p>This lab implements two programs that read input from a file and write output to a file. It also includes exceptions handling with try-catch and command-line arguments manipulation.</p>

## Map On Queue
<p>This lab is to implement and test a kernel component <em>Map2</em> layered on top of <em>Queue</em>.<p>

## List with Two Smart Nodes
<p>This lab is to work with linked structures by modifying a given implementation of the kernel component <em>List2</em> implemented with a singly-linked list. The given implementation uses only one "smart" node at the start of the singly-linked list. After modification a second smart node should be placed at the end of the list.</p>

## Tokenizer
<p>This lab is to provide a <em>Tokenizer</em> utility class with the task of tokenizing a simple input.</p>

## Stack with LinkedList
<p>This lab is to work with linked structures by implementing and testing a kernel component <em>Stack2</em> implemented with a singly-linked list.

## Set on Queue
<p>This lab is to implement and test a kernel component <em>Set2</em> implemented on <em>Queue</em>.</p>

## Binary Tree
<p>This lab is to get familiar with using the <em>BinaryTree</em> component and recursion by writing the <em>height</em> and <em>isInTree</em> static, generic methods for <em>BinaryTree<<T>T></em>.</p>

## Binary Search Tree
<p>This lab is to get a better understanding of binary search trees and practice using the <em>BinaryTree</em> component and recursion by writing and testing the <em>isInTree</em> static, generic method for <em>BinaryTree<<T>T></em>.</p>

## Sequence Smooth
<p>This lab is to practice writing the smooth static method for <em>Sequence<</em><em>Integer></em> in a couple different ways and testing implementations with JUnit test fixture.<p>

## Glossary
<p>This project creates a relatively easy-to-maintain glossary facility in HTML format.</p>

>A glossary is a list of difficult or specialized words, or terms, with their definitions, that is usually near the end of a book. 

## Crypto Utilities
<p>This project is about public-key cryptography, which is a crucial factor in Internet's secure communication. One popular public-key cryptographic scheme, <em>RSA</em>, is provably secure under the assumption that factoring of such large numbers is so expensive in terms of execution time as to be computationally infeasible in practice. RSA relies on the ability to decide efficiently whether such a large number is prime, i.e., whether it has any non-trivial factors at all.<n> The project implements a few utility methods that could be used in cryptographic computations, including one that can generate a huge number that is very likely a prime number.</p>

## Expression Evaluator
<p>This program calculates the value of an expression consisting of numbers, arithmetic operators, and parentheses.</p>

## Natural Number Calculator
<p>Develop a complete calculator application with MVC design(<em>model, view,controller</em>) that uses the <em>NaturalNumber</em> components: a natural number calculator. It works just like any other calculator except that it does exact arithmetic with natural numbers that have no explicit bounds on their values.
